With small classes, an open curriculum, and a sole focus on undergraduate education, the average class size is about 19 students and the full-time instructional faculty is just over 200. On campus, The Powerhouse is a renovated steam plant that now hosts live performances, movie screenings, art exhibits, panel discussions, pub nights, outdoor picnics and more. The Amherst College Wildlife Sanctuary rests on about 500 acres of land and is the site of ongoing research and teaching by students and faculty. The land is managed by the Amherst Facilities Department to support conservation of animals. The Amherst mascot is a mammoth and their colors are purple and white. The distinguished science program at Amherst offers The Incubator Program, a cohort designed to support and train students who are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, and The Moss Quantitative Center where students learn to analyze data. A commencement tradition is to give each graduate a chestnut cane known as The Conway Canes. This Amherst tradition is a metaphor for a college education, because it supports graduates throughout their lives. Noteworthy alumni include the 30th president of the United States Calvin Coolidge, economist Joseph Stiglitz, and author David Foster Wallace.

For example, the course GEO S10 is designed to develop geologic field skills; therefore, students and faculty traveled to the Northern Rockies of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana to investigate economic geology at sites like Yellowstone National Park. The Mount Davis Summit is Bates’ annual campus-wide event where freshmen and sophomore students can test their skills by presenting their individual research to a wide audience. Student creative work in art, dance, theater, music and film/video; projects from academic courses, and community-engaged research is also presented at The Summit. Notable alumni include, Robert F.

Situated less than an hour from Los Angeles, Claremont McKenna offers 33 majors with accelerated, joint, or dual degree programs across its 13 academic departments. Top majors from the class of 2022 include economics, government, and international relations, with nearly half of the students receiving financial aid. While Claremont McKenna has one of the lowest acceptance rates for liberal arts schools, outcomes reveal that upon graduation, most students enter the workforce full-time within six months. Students benefit from small class sizes, due to the university’s 8:1 student-to-faculty ratio and average class sizes containing fewer than 20 students. Community and engagement can be fostered through one of the 50+ clubs and organizations the campus has to offer. Perhaps the most recognizable of the university’s alumni was the beloved actor and comedian, Robin Williams.",claremont-mckenna-college,Private not-for-profit,Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus,8,8803524.0,53.0,49.0,76.2,85.7,73.8,78.6,71.4,69.0,52.4,72.44

The tradition of Running Down the Hill is when the football team dressed at Fike Field House and ran from there to the gate and down a grassy hill onto the field at the start of each game. Bowman Field separates campus from the town of Clemson and students gather here to relax, play games and celebrate special occasions. Clemson’s 17 Living-Learning Communities are where student living spaces collide with study halls and social networking opportunities. Through these communities, undergraduate students with similar interests, hobbies or backgrounds are assigned to the same residence hall. Clemson has over 500 registered student organizations and Tiger Prowl is the University’s largest student involvement fair where students can connect and explore extra-curricular opportunities. The Cooperative Education Program offers a structured academic engaged-learning experience to undergraduate students where each student is monitored by the program’s academic staff. Not only do students gain hands-on experience in their field of study but many students go on to work for their co-op employers after graduation. Notable alumni include singer-songwriter Lee Brice and actor Rob Huebel.

The community consists of about 2,000 students who can apply for a Venture Grant to travel to India and research the impacts of tourism, join the Outdoor Recreation Committee and lead a canyoneering trip in Utah, study the stars, swing into ballroom dance and more. Notable alumni include former Second Lady of the United States Lynne Cheney, United States Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar, and American economist James Heckman.

All students choose one of three majors: mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, or a flexible general engineering major that allows for specialization in fields like bioengineering or design and robotics. All community members adhere to an honor code that demands integrity, respect for others and an openness to innovation. 2022 saw the inauguration of Olin’s second president Dr. Gilda Barabino, the college’s first Black woman president. In August 2023, Olin welcomed 100 new students to the Class of 2027–the largest in recent memory, according to the college. As part of student life, all students live on campus and Olin offers more than 50 student groups to strengthen involvement. Olin offers both need-based and merit-based financial aid, including the Olin Tuition Scholarship which is available to all enrolled students and has a value of more than $115,000.",franklin-w-olin-college-of-engineering,Private not-for-profit,Special Focus Four-Year: Engineering and Other Technology-Related Schools,8,3687532.0,100.0,100.0,,,,,,,,

Boasting a tight-knit community of about 2,500 students, Furman provides them with a curriculum of 50 undergraduate majors and 15 minors. Many students study business, communications, and political science. More than 90% of students partake in engaged learning experiences that range from summer research fellowships to student conferences. Through the university’s “Furman Advantage,” all students are guaranteed access to study away, internship and research opportunities. Students represent all walks of life, coming from 44 states and 43 countries. Since the 1960s, Furman has had a history of championing diversity and inclusion, desegregating the university during the height of the Civil Rights movement. In 1968, Joseph Vaughn became the first Black student to graduate from the school. Decades later, Furman continues to foster the spirit of inclusivity through more than 160 student organizations. The Paladins compete at the Division I level and are members of the Southern Conference. Entering students mark the start of their Furman journey by walking along the campus's tree-lined mall, and upon graduating, students exit that same tree-lined path. Other traditions have featured events like the homecoming carnival, and celebrating seniors’ last day of class by swimming in the campus fountains, complete with pool floats. Notable Furman University alumni include Lay’s founder Herman Lay, author George Singleton and Kabbage founder Kathryn Petralia.

Founded in 1793, the private liberal arts school is the third oldest college in New York State. Admissions revealed an acceptance rate of less than 12 percent for the class of 2026, with 86 percent of students ranked among the top of their high school class. Hamilton offers 44 majors and 57 areas of study with the most popular majors including economics, math, and research & experimental psychology. While Hamilton only has about 2,000 enrolled students, students can take advantage of small class sizes with the school’s 9:1 student-faculty ratio, and the majority of classes have fewer than 20 students. Hamilton is committed to making necessary financial provisions for students through its financial aid promise, with approximately half of the students utilizing financial aid. When students aren’t studying, they can participate in campus events including “Feb Fest,” where students can compete in snow sculpture contests and chili cook-offs. If the cold isn’t your thing, then the HamTrek sprint triathlon takes place during the last weekend of spring classes, where students can swim, bike, and run a 5k to victory.

JMU provides more than 400 scholarships every year to freshman and incoming students that includes merit-based, need-based, and transfer scholarships. JMU hosts more than 400 clubs and organizations, with over 4,200 students involved in Greek life, and students complete 14,000 hours of community service each year. A lifelike 5-foot-4 James Madison statue dubbed “Little Jimmy” and a larger-than-life “Big Jimmy” statue are cherished campus landmarks. JMU’s official mascot is the Duke Dog, an English Bulldog with a purple and gold crown. A menacing 2,100-pound Duke Dog statue guards the athletic facilities. JMU graduates tend to stay close by—51% of recent graduates work in Virginia and 11% work in Washington D.C., two hours from JMU’s campus.",james-madison-university,Public,Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity,17,15898024.0,58.0,33.0,63.7,69.1,70.6,73.5,68.6,58.8,78.4,68.96

On campus, students have access to rare books, manuscripts and archives. Off campus, using the school’s free shuttle service, students can explore the museums and landmarks of the city. The biennial event, Hopkins on the Hill, calls upon hundreds of delegates, legislators, congressional staffers and representatives from government agencies to view the federally funded research and programming at Johns Hopkins University. America’s first research university encourages its scholars to ask big questions. Today, these questions have led to significant medical advances as well as technology designed to explore outer space. With nearly 3,700 active patents, Johns Hopkins research is responsible for potable water in the 1920’s to 21st-century prosthetic limbs. Noteworthy alumni include former CEO of IBM, Sam Palmisano, Chief White House correspondent for NBC News Hallie Jackson, and former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

Founded in 1833, the college is placed among the 100 oldest institutions in the country. Students choose from 31 academic majors, 22 minors, and 13 concentrations. Kalamazoo’s academics are centered around the “K-Plan,” an individualized, four-year study plan that incorporates an open curriculum, study abroad, experiential learning and a senior year capstone. Of the 1,300 enrolled students, 98% receive need or merit-based financial aid. More than half of Kalamazoo students live on campus. In 2022, endowment totals exceeded $260 million. The Hornets are members of the nation’s oldest collegiate athletics conference, the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Kalamazoo has more than 80 student organizations for students to join. On Kalamazoo’s “Day of Gracious Living,” classes are canceled in favor of a beach day followed by a party. No one knows the date of the event beforehand, and it is randomly selected and kept secret by the college’s student representative president—a beloved tradition of nearly 50 years. Kalamazoo College has produced several prominent names in entertainment, including Tony Award-winning playwright Lisa Kron, actor Steven Yeun and comedian Jordan Klepper.",kalamazoo-college,Private not-for-profit,Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus,10,15653658.0,100.0,98.0,,,,,,,,

The college refines the academic experience through several paid research opportunities, as well as university-wide publications to strengthen students’ writing—a valued skill that Kenyon develops in students. All applicants are considered for merit scholarships that range from $10,000 to $25,000 annually. Kenyon also has talent scholarships for art, music or writing, along with awards for those from underrepresented backgrounds. Beyond academics, there are more than 100 student organizations to take part in, including Greek Life. All Kenyon students stay on campus, where first-year students choose from five residence halls. The Kenyon College Owls play in the North Coast Athletic Conference. Treasured customs include plenty of singing.

The school offers over 50 areas of study across four divisions, including humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. Lafayette’s curriculum allows for student creativity, encouraging students to double major or design their own course of study. Recent self-designed majors include “technology and law” and “animal science.” 2022 admissions saw an acceptance rate of around 33% for the class of 2026. Lafayette awards both merit scholarships and need-based scholarships, awarding nearly $18 million to the class of 2025. The college also awards 10 first-year students the merit-based Marquis Fellowship scholarship which covers full tuition, and 50 others the Marquis Scholarship at half-tuition. Students can strengthen their academic involvement through study abroad and research activities, where many engineering students study abroad in Lafayette’s faculty-led programs in Germany and Spain. In terms of athletics, the Lafayette Leopards compete in 23 NCAA Division I sports. Student traditions have included Lafayette’s rivalry week against Lehigh University, and an annual National Day of Service known as Lafapalooza.",lafayette-college,Private not-for-profit,Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus,10,19135754.0,98.0,98.0,63.0,69.4,75.9,70.4,87.0,70.4,81.5,73.94

With 13 undergraduate interdisciplinary programs, the student-to-faculty ratio is 10:1. Leigh’s official mascot is the Mountain Hawk that debuted in 1995 and the school colors are brown and white. Although the species of a Mountain Hawk does not exist, spot hawks often fly over South Mountain. The Lehigh-Lafayette rivalry is one of the most celebrated in all of college football and the annual Spirit Week is the week leading up to this game where students form teams and decorate beds and drag race them down Memorial Walk. Another highlight of Spirit Week is when the Marching 97 band members head through campus serenading classrooms with the traditional Lehigh fight songs. From the Brown and White barbeque to movies on the lawn, to Founder’s Day, this school is rich in tradition and school spirit, fostering a sense of community in the small town of Bethlehem. The Academic Life and Student Transitions team is a resource that is committed to helping students with academic success through workshops and discussions about study skills to conversations about transitioning to Lehigh. Leigh competes at the Division 1 level with a total of 25 sports for men and women or there are 41 intramural and club sports teams that students can participate in.  Other campus highlights include the Lehigh therapy dogs Grace and Scout, studying under Linderman’s rotunda, and planning your team’s bed race costumes months in advance. Notable alumni include executive Lee Lacocca, Pulitzer-Prize winner and journalist Martin Baron,  executive Bill Amelio, and businessman Roger Penske and MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle.

Outside of the classroom, student activities can range from visiting the university’s art museum to celebrating National Marquette Day, a tradition held for over 25 years. Marquette has produced famed alumni that include NBA legend Dwyane Wade and the late comedian and actor Chris Farley—a beloved Saturday Night Live cast member. Marquette University awards a scholarship in Farley’s honor.

Last year’s fiscal year saw MIT’s endowment total $24.6 billion, with funds going toward research, education, and scholarships. As of 2023, families with a typical income of less than $140,000 will have tuition fully covered for undergraduate students, thanks to endowments. Apart from its wide range of academic programs, incoming students can expect to sport MIT’s cardinal red and silver gray colors around campus. What thrives almost as much as its education, is the school’s prank culture that includes everything from stealing a giant inflatable duck from Harvard to draping a Duke University flag across a campus building to welcome newly appointed MIT president Sally Kornbluth’s transition from Duke.

Pepperdine offers more than 40 majors in its undergraduate school, Seaver College. Many students at the college complete degrees in business administration, psychology, and international studies. Average class sizes have fewer than 20 students, allowing for specialized attention. The estimated undergraduate cost of attendance exceeds $90,000 for the 2023-2024 academic year. The university indicates that because admission is already highly competitive, certain scholarships are often a reflection of the school’s selective nature. Pepperdine does, however, award several other financial aid packages to its high-caliber students. Pepperdine is home to more than 100 student clubs, as well as 13 fraternities and sororities. 74% of undergraduates live on campus. The Pepperdine Waves sponsor 17 NCAA Division I varsity teams. “Songfest”, the school’s longest-running student tradition allows hundreds of students to perform in a 12-minute musical production and showcase their theatrical side. Many Pepperdine graduates have gone on to become big stars in entertainment, including actresses and sisters Tia and ​​Tamera Mowry, and grammy nominated artist Montell Jordan.",pepperdine-university,Private not-for-profit,Doctoral/Professional Universities,13,31215688.0,95.0,94.0,77.0,76.3,70.0,84.2,77.5,56.7,91.0,76.1

As a result, students receive a specialized arts education from RISD and a sciences and humanities-focused education from Brown. RISD hosts more than 70 student clubs and organizations, from cultural groups to special interest clubs, like beekeeping. Each year, the school holds an Artist Ball, where students dress in costumes based on the yearly theme and playfully engage in a costume competition, followed by dancing and food.

The university prides itself on being California's first coeducational university and continues to be the only Methodist-affiliated university in the state. The university’s main campus is located in Stockton, Calif. and the school operates additional campuses in Sacramento and San Francisco. Pacific has a combined enrollment of nearly 6,300 students as of Fall 2022. The university offers around 80 undergraduate programs across nine schools and colleges. The majority of undergraduates take an experiential learning course, where they apply knowledge from the classroom to internships that count for academic credit. Pacific awards academic merit scholarships to both first-year undergraduate students and transfer students. The university is home to more than 150 clubs and student organizations. Pacific reported that 91% of students were working in their field or continuing their education within six months of graduating. The Pacific Tigers play at the Division I level and compete in the West Coast Conference. Students often participate in “Pacific Fridays,” a relatively new school tradition from 2021 where each week, the community wears orange, tiger stripes, and more to show school pride. Notable alumni include baseball agent Scott Boras, holder of the top spot on Forbes’ most powerful sports agent list, and astronaut Jose Hernandez.",university-of-the-pacific,Private not-for-profit,Doctoral/Professional Universities,14,28664663.0,96.0,96.0,,,,,,,,

In 2023, Yale’s competitive admissions reportedly accepted less than 5 percent of applicants, the lowest acceptance rate in recent school history. The university offers degree-granting academic programs from 14 schools, including Yale College, Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, and Yale Professional School. The university prides itself on its research efforts, with over 70 core research facilities and $900 million in external funding for fiscal year ‘22. Over half of undergraduate students received scholarships/grants for 2021-22. New students are expected to reside at Yale’s on-campus housing facilities for their first and second years, so they can look forward to making New Haven their new home. Students can engage with the Yale community by taking part in athletic traditions and meeting Handsome Dan, the school’s bulldog mascot.",yale-university,Private not-for-profit,Doctoral Universities: Very High Research Activity,6,58441279.0,59.0,52.0,96.8,86.3,88.3,66.1,74.7,68.8,86.6,81.09
